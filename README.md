## **What Drives Me**

I focus on building technology that delivers measurable results. Whether achieving 500% speed improvements through parallel processing or 98% detection accuracy in computer vision models, I prioritize pushing technical boundaries.

My work spans from enterprise RAG systems processing large document sets to memory allocators optimized for performance. I believe in creating AI systems that are intelligent, fast, scalable, and production-ready. Every optimization and model I develop is driven by real-world impact.
